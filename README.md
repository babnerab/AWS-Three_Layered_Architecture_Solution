# AWS-Three_Layered_Architecture_Solution
**Description**

As part of my project portfolio, I have devised and executed an AWS architecture for a three-tiered application by leveraging various AWS services. These services encompass Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Application Load Balancer (ALB), Classic Load Balancer (CLB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), Autoscaling, Amazon Route53, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and more.

The architecture effectively utilizes EC2 for scalable computing resources, RDS for managed database services, and VPC for secure networking and isolation. The load balancing mechanism is efficiently managed by ALB, CLB, and NLB, distributing traffic among EC2 instances based on the specific requirements of the application. Autoscaling is implemented to dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to fluctuating application demands.

Route53 is employed for DNS management and routing purposes, while ACM ensures secure communication between the application and end-users by handling SSL/TLS certificate management. CloudWatch plays a vital role in comprehensive monitoring and logging services, enabling proactive management of the application.

SNS is utilized for timely notifications and alerts, promptly informing stakeholders in the event of any issues. To achieve continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild are employed. CodePipeline offers a fully managed CI/CD service, while CodeBuild is responsible for building and testing the application.

Finally, S3 serves as a reliable and scalable storage solution for static files and artifacts, providing a cost-effective approach to storage for the application.

Overall, this AWS architecture delivers a highly available, scalable, and secure environment for the three-tieredÂ application.
